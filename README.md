This is a 3 person group project with main focus on consolidation. We created a fictional startup called MOODFIX. Each member created a page.


## Objectives
The objective was to learn in group and finish a project to present to a client. GIT was the main tool here, gitting gud in GIT is an objective on it's own !

## Code style
As we could choose the styling we went for Bootstrap, CSS & HTML.
